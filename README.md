# Android
Repository for an old tester android project that has limited working features.
Needs to be rewritten and restructured. 

Functional idea was to take photos in either burst mode or individually and stick them together to make a sprite.
This would be useful for assets for game designers or for people who want to make gifs.

Web based tools like this are available, however being able to do this on your mobile device would be a great benefit to game designers as the end product or a solid baseline to work from.

Note for next iteration. 
Make a or employ a library that allows you to use the camera in burst mode so as to be compatible for all phones as native camera app often has different desired ordering or photoâ€™s. 
Scaling of the image itself can be done by bitmap scaling, or refine existing algorithm use for practice.
